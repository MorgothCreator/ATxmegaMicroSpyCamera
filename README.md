DIY Micro spy camera 

This project is intended to make most tiny DIY spy camera with an ATxmega32E5 microcontroller.
At this moment has the ability to read the BW sensor and stream data in raw binary format to serial port with 1000000bps.
The data can be read with a PC application and displayed on a window.

In future it will write the images captured from sensor to a uSD memory card in a raw format.
